## MLOps

[Compare Runs from WandB at PR](MLOps/WandBPR) -> Pulling 'comparative runs report' between baseline model and another model (whose run ID is supplied) from Weights&Biases whenever a trigger (in this case '/wandb \<run id>\') is detected in a pull request. The automated comment with a link to the report is made using <a href='https://github.com/fastai/ghapi'>GHApi</a>.

[Interacting with APIs](MLOps/InteractingWithAPIs) -> The repo has a Python script and Jupyter file to demonstrate using Python to interact with the <a href='https://www.ravelry.com/api#index'>Revelry API</a> via the requests library to retrieve information about different Revelry resources. It builds upon the work presented in a Medium <a href='https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-to-access-an-api-for-first-time-api-users-879002f5f58d'>article</a>.
